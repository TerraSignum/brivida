# Terms of Service

## 1. Scope
These Terms govern the use of the Brivida marketplace between customers and independent cleaning professionals. By registering or posting a job you agree to these conditions.

## 2. Services Provided
Brivida offers matchmaking, scheduling tools, chat, payment handling, and review features. Brivida is not an employer and does not become a contracting party to the cleaning agreement. Service delivery remains the sole responsibility of the professional.

## 3. Customer Responsibilities
Customers provide accurate information about the property, requested services, time windows, and special requirements. Changes or cancellations must be submitted through the app. Ratings and documentation are also handled on the platform.

## 4. Professional Responsibilities
Professionals keep their profile, availability, and pricing up to date. Leads are accepted only when the job can be fulfilled. After completion, professionals upload documentation and invite the customer to leave feedback.

## 5. Fees and Payments
Accepted leads may incur credit deductions or lead fees. For in-app payments processed via Stripe Connect, the displayed service fees apply. Payouts are released after job completion or 24 hours after customer confirmation.

## 6. Liability
Contracts are concluded directly between customer and professional. Brivida is not liable for the execution or outcome of the cleaning service. In case of disputes, Brivida provides moderation and evidence management without assuming legal responsibility for damages.

## 7. Changes to the Terms
Brivida may update these Terms. Any changes will be announced at least 14 days before they take effect. If you do not accept the new Terms you may be restricted from further using the platform.
