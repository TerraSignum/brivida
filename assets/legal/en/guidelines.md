# Community Guidelines

## 1. Respectful Conduct
All members treat each other with respect, refrain from discrimination, and comply with applicable laws. Offensive, violent, or illegal content is prohibited.

## 2. Communication on Platform
Binding agreements, schedule changes, and clarifications must be documented via the Brivida chat or provided tools. This ensures transparency for both parties.

## 3. Safety and Documentation
Professionals upload relevant certificates (e.g., business registration, liability insurance). Customers provide safe working conditions and disclose known risks before the job starts.

## 4. Violations
Brivida may issue warnings, temporarily suspend, or permanently deactivate accounts that violate these rules. Repeated fraud attempts will be escalated to support and, if necessary, to authorities.
